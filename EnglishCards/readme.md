#English Cards
##About
This is one of the earliest projects I ever created using Visual Studio 4.0 and MFC, back at the late 90's...
It is an educational memory cards game with some deviation - 
The player is required to pick up some random card.
The card is presented along with an English spelled word that desribes the action the card depicts.
The player have a few seconds to analyze how this word is spelled.
Then, the word disappears, leaving the player to try and type the word in the correct spelling.
If the player succeeded spelling correctly and in time, the other 'twin' cards opens for him automatically.
If the player spells incorrectly, or time is up before spelling was completed, the player is given the opportunity
to try and pick-up the 'twin' card from the board manually, based on memory or luck.

##Motivation
This game was inspired by a friend of mine back at those 90's, where she taught kids the English language.
One of her accessories was a memory cards game, that she spread on the table and let the kids play with it,
asking him to pronounce the word that was printed on the card.
I got this idea that I can use my nice hand-held scanner device I had, scan those cards,
and come up with a digital memory card. I also thought of this idea of letting the kids spell in a timeframe,
and that would make him remember the spelling and also let him play on its own.
